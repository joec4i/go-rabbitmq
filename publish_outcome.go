// separate streams, the confirmation and the return of the same message are

//
// Requirements and semantics:
//   - The publisher must be created with WithPublisherOptionsConfirm.
//   - Detecting unroutable messages requires WithPublishOptionsMandatory;
//     without it the broker silently drops and still acks unroutable messages.
//   - Every message is tagged with an OutcomeIDHeader header used for
//     correlation; consumers of the message can see it.
//   - When the channel is lost mid-flight, the outcome resolves with
//     ErrOutcomeUnknown: the message may or may not have been delivered, so
//     republishing can duplicate it.
//   - WithPublisherOptionsMaxOutcomesInFlight bounds memory by blocking
//     publishes until earlier outcomes resolve.
//   - The underlying client notifies all basic.return listeners sequentially
//     before processing further frames, so a slow handler registered with
//     NotifyReturn on the same publisher delays outcome resolution (it cannot
